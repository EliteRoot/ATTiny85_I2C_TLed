# ATTiny85_I2C_TLed
Building a Supercapacitor Circuit with a SHT15/BME, ATTiny85 and Micro OLED

I've been pulling from tons of repositories and rewriting stiched code for this frankencode project. Most of these chips are $2 knockoffs from Aliexpress that don't work like the rest of the bunch. So there's custom patches to registers all over.. like an SSD1306 128x64 bit driver running a 64x32 OLED display and writing start of display at 32, 32 , 0. It's madness! So enjoy the ride.. you've been warned.
